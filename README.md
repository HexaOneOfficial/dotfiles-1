<h3 align="center">Custom Firefox</h3>

My Firefox userChrome is just a modified version of [u/otto251](https://www.reddit.com/user/otto251/)'s ultra-minimal Firefox setup, I have removed some of the rounding and changed the colors and fonts. My startpage is a super fucked up version of one that I found on [r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/).

Links can be changed by editing the `index.html` file in the `.mozilla/startpage/` folder.

`wallpaper` command randomly sets a wallpaper from the `~/Pictures/wallpapers` directory on your computer. `mpc` commands do what their names say, but `mpc info` will open up a small Alacritty window displaying information about the currently playing song. Dependencies for this can be installed with this command:
`sudo pacman -S mpd mpc feh alacritty`

Font used in menu is [Proggy](https://github.com/bluescan/proggyfonts)
